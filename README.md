# PHP Tek 2026 Conference Website

This repository contains the official website for the PHP Tek 2026 conference, a premier event for PHP and web
development professionals.

## About the Project

PHP Tek 2026 is a web application built with Laravel that serves as the official website for the PHP Tek conference
scheduled for May 19-21, 2026. The website provides information about the conference, venue details, and will eventually
support features like registration, speaker submissions, and schedule management.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP 8.2+**
- **Laravel 10.x** - PHP Framework
- **MySQL/MariaDB** - Database
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Vite** - Frontend build tool
- **Livewire** - Interactive components

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Important thing to note

Certain components are commented out like schedule, speakers, and sponsors. These are committed out so that when new
deployments are done those components don't display until we have content to add to them. If you are interested in
working these components you are welcomed to do so.
